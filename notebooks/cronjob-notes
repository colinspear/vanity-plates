Launchd
- Good [overview post](https://beepb00p.xyz/scheduler.html) on scheduling options (say something about cloud options)
- Really a pretty annoying tool
- Create plist (xml) file
- use launchctl from command line to execute
- Some GUI solutions, [web app](launched.zerowidth.com) - doesn\'t seem to be a useful command line tool that will generate a plist file for you. I used the zerowidth web app
- [launchd.info](launchd.info) has everything you need to write your plist files and schedule your jobs
- Definitely a bit of a pain, but not complicated once you get the hang
